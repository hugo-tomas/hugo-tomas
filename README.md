### üåü Main Projects

- **Master's Dissertation:** Exploring imputation techniques for reconstructing CT lung images using generative models, aimed at improving the reuse of data compromised by medical artifacts.
- **Bachelor's Project:** Investigated green tea extract as an adjuvant in chemotherapy for breast and colon cancer models.
- **Extracurricular Research:** Developed a 3D carcinogenesis model using CompuCell3D technology to study the impact of gap junctions on tumor evolution.
- **Other Curricular Projects:**
  - **Brain Segmentation:** Developed a tool to segment the brain in continuous time or at the single image level. The process is performed across 3 cuts: coronal, sagittal, and axial.
  - **Heartbeat Monitoring:** Designed a system for real-time monitoring of heartbeats using an Electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor. This project processed and displayed various metrics derived from ECG signals.
